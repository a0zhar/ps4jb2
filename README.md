# Custom Version of Sleirsgoevy's PS4JB2

The PS4JB2 repository contains a complete chain exploit for PS4 firmware 6.72. Essentially, it is TheFlow's proof of concept combined with PS4-specific kROP and kernel patches.

The purpose of this repository is to provide a version of Sleir's repository with the following enhancements:
- Documented to the best of my understanding
- Easier to maintain and work with
- More efficient and maintainable code
- And more...

It currently includes files related to the FW 6.72 version of PS4JB. If you come across any incorrect comments or would like to offer assistance, please create an issue on this repository or contact me on Discord.
